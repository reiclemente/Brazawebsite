   <p>During a period of Portuguese discoveries and through a large colonial empire, the language was spread to areas in Africa, Asia and the Americas.
   Today, Portuguese continues to thrive through the presence of large expat communities of Brazilians, Portuguese, Cape Verdeans, and Angolans found throughout the world.
   Over 210 million people throughout the world speak Portuguese as their native tongue and 184 million are from Brazil alone.</p>
   
   <p>Understanding Portuguese helps when starting to learn any other language like Spanish, Italian, French and Romanian.
   Knowledge of one makes it much easier to understand the others, since they all evolved from Latin and share many grammar and syntax, 
   and have lots of similar vocabulary.</p>

   <blockquote cite="https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/top-5-reasons-to-learn-portuguese/"> 
   "The Portuguese language, especially as it’s spoken in Brazil, is possibly the most mellifluous, honey-smooth mode of communication on Earth.<br>
   It simply sounds like music and is a joy to listen to, but it’s an even greater pleasure when you can also understand and take part in the sonorous, lilting song that is the Portuguese language. 
   No wonder Portugal and Brazil have such rich musical traditions."
